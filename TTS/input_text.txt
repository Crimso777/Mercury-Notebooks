The rise of malbec from Argentina has been unstoppable over the last decade. With its luscious boom of blueberries and licorice, scent of violets, smooth taste, and sometimes also the suggestion of chocolate, itâ€™s easy to see why it has become the red stalwart of supermarket shelves and gastropub wine lists alike. Bold and joyful, you could say that Argentinian malbec is the red equivalent of sauvignon blanc from New Zealand.
